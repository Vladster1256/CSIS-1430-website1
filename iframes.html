        <h1>North Salt Lake responds to landslide with stricter building ordinance proposal</h1>
        
        <p>About a year ago there was a landslide that occured that wiped out a home, city leaders are considering a new ordinance that are more strict for the developers of homes. Which means that homes must be build with more quality to insure less chance of self colapse</p>

        <p>This article is basically saying how the city leaders are setting restrictions on what is required for land on a home. This will be tightened up from before and this will result in better homes in better, safer locations so we don't get homes built in poor locations.
            This is good as we can live with less stress on newer homes so we don't get a crappy land lot where the land can give out on them. Any land with a slope less than 30% could be considered an area with critical concern due to decreased stability. The land would have to be surveyed by 
            a person from the city and will ensure in better land. A third-party engineer will oversee construction and be paid for by the developer.</p>
        <p> People from the city want these new houses built with the most amount of safety possible. The city already has plans on how to push this new method of testing the land and analizing it.
        "I think the landslide has made us more aware of the need to be vigilant in the foothills," Leetham said. "Not that we haven't been in the past, but it's brought some issues to our attention." This means that these new methods should be pushed out there very soon.</p>
