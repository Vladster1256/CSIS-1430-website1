<h2> This a Heading</h2>
Hello.  This is not a very exciting document.
I
    bet you were 
expecting <em> 
poetry</em>, or
some kind of <strong> exciting <br>
fact</strong> about the Internet and
the World Wide Web.
<p> Sorry, No such luck.
This document
does
contain examples of HTML markup, 
for example, here is 
an unordered list:
<ul>
    <li> One item in 
the list
<li> A second list item <li> A third list item that 
goes on and on and
on to indicate that the 
lists can wrap right around the page and still be
nicely formatted by the browsers.
<li> The final item on the list
</ul>
<p>Lists are exciting.  You can also have 
ordered lists (the items are numbered)
and description lists.
<hr>
<p>And you can draw horizontal lines, which are useful for dividing
sections.
