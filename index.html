	<p align="center">Hello! I am Vladlen Garder and I am currently in CSIS 1430 for Basic Website design. I am making this site for that class and i need to make some
	 website that introduces me so I decided to go for it. I am currently taking classes at SLCC for my Accociates of Applied Science for Computer Science.
	  I taken some web page design class at my High School and I decided to take the class at college so I can get it for my major. I love to play videogames.
	  My current favorite videogame is Super Smash Bros. 4. I also work at my local arcade and I'm one of the attendants who actually knows how to fix most of the problems.
	  As long as I don't have to touch the monitors or the boards where part of the circuit fried i'm fine. </p>
